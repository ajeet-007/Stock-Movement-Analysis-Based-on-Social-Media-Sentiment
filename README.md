# Stock Market Trend Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis  

Welcome to the **Stock Market Trend Prediction** project! This repository provides the resources and code for a cutting-edge machine learning approach that integrates sentiment analysis with advanced algorithms to forecast stock market trends accurately.

---

## Project Overview  
Stock market prediction requires complex analysis of various factors. This project leverages machine learning models like **BERT**, **Vedar**, and **Naïve Bayes** to perform sentiment analysis on data from **Twitter** and other sources. Combined with historical price data, these insights create a robust and practical prediction model.

---

## Objectives  
- **Accurately Predict Stock Market Trends**: Enable traders and investors to make informed decisions.  
- **Provide Valuable Insights**: Combine sentiment and historical data for actionable market analysis.  
- **Develop a Holistic Model**: Integrate sentiment analysis with machine learning for comprehensive predictions.  

---

## Features  
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Use BERT, Vedar, and Naïve Bayes for sentiment detection.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze tweets and other data for market sentiment scoring.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Eliminate noise, normalize text, and extract key features.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics to measure prediction accuracy and refine models.  
- **Practical Application**: Provide insights that guide investors and traders effectively.
